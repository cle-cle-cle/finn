            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Yazhi Fan. You can also call me Finn. <br>
                I'm a professional game developer as well as a passionate hobbyist. <br>
                This website is a space for sharing my hobbyist projects, things that are too long to fit on a resume, but still reflect my love for making games.
            </p>

            <h2>Favourite Games</h2>
            <p>
                My favourite shooters are Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009), S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl (2007) and Dead Space. <br>
                My favourite simulation and survival games are The Sims, Project Zomboid, Don't Starve, and Oxygen Not Included. <br>
            </p>
            
            <h2>Favourite Engines</h2>
            <p>
                For hobby game dev, my #1 favourite engine is Godot. <br>
                I have a good amount of experience with Unreal and Unity, and lightweight engines like PuzzleScript and RPGMaker. I love trying out new things. <br>
                With over 6 years of professional work experience in C++, I'm comfortable working with in-house or custom-built engines. <br>
            </p>
            
            <h2>Game Jams</h2>
            <p>
                I love participating in game jams during my free time, and I've joined over 20 so far.

            <h2>Unreal</h2>
            <p>
                I had two medium to large learning projects made with Unreal.<br>
                The first one was a multiplayer card game, which I eventually abandoned due to frustrations with Unreal 4's UI system. I still find the Unreal 5 UI system cluncky.<br>
                However, that project taught me a great deal about Unreal’s multiplayer networking model, including replication, RPCs, and session handling. I was able to host my half-working prototypes for lobby setup and synchronized game state over the Steam network with ease. <br>
                Among all the commercial engines I’ve tried, I find Unreal’s networking system to be the most developer friendly and well maintained. This made me fall in love with Unreal engine, and I wanted to do something more with the engine. <br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I collaborated with an artist for the second Unreal learning project, which was a third-person shooter with narrative dialogues and quests.<br>
                This project was a C++ and Blueprint hybrid. We made four mini vertical slice levels, and I had fun designing the sewer map for the shooter section.<br>

            <h2>Work Likes and Dislikes</h2>
            <p>
                I love making clean, easy to use tools that speed up development. <br>
                I also love doing things that no games have ever done before, especially things that are high impact for the entire gameplay experience. <br>
                I dislike spending too much time on details that I don't think any player is going to notice or is not going to affect gameplay (things one can only notice when in 5x slowmo). Although I acknowledge that deatails can add up, and I admire people who are dedicated in the details. <br>
            </p>

            <h2>Scool and Past Life as a Device Engineer</h2>
            <p>I studied Electrical Computer Engineering at school, and my first job was device engineer. I learned a lot of low level programming skills at school, as well as Compiler, Operating Systems, and Computer Architecture. </p>
            <p>As a device engineer, I did a lot of work around Linux embeded devices, C++, and C. </p>

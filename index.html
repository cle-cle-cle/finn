        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Yazhi Fan. You can also call me Finn. <br>
            I'm a professional game developer as well as a passionate hobbyist. <br>
            This website is a space for sharing my hobbyist projects, things that are too long to fit on a resume, but still reflect my love for making games.
        </p>


        <h2>Favourite Games</h2>
        <p>
            My favourite shooters are Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009), S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl (2007) and Dead Space. <br>
            My favourite simulation and survival games are The Sims, Project Zomboid, Don't Starve, and Oxygen Not Included. <br>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Favourite Engines</h2>
        <p>
            For hobby game dev, my #1 favourite engine is Godot. <br>
            I have a good amount of experience with Unreal and Unity, and lightweight engines like PuzzleScript and RPGMaker. I love trying out new things. <br>
            With over 6 years of professional work experience in C++, I'm also comfortable working with in-house or custom-built engines. <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Game Jams</h2>

        <p>
            I love participating in game jams during my free time, and I've joined over 20 so far.
